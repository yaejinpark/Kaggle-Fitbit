# Kaggle-Fitbit
Data Analysis on Kaggle's FitBit Tracker Data

1. First get unique customerIDs from any csv file through BigQuery
2. Choose MySQL or postgreSQL for creating relational tables
3. Clean files with chosen DBMS or R (or Sheets. Pandas can also be an option)
4. Look for more trends
5. Do analysis for questions presented in the rubric (trends that I find on my own as #1)

Do I need to get unique customerIDs from the start? Can I just start looking for trends in R and then create a DB and then get customerIDs from there? It's possible that not all of the csv files have all customerIDs...
